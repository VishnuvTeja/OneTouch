# OneTouch Application

OneTouch is a simple web application that provides quick access to various sectors. Users can navigate to specific sectors, such as Infrastructure, Pharma, and Retail, to access relevant links and information.

This project demonstrates the use of HTML and CSS to create an interactive and visually appealing user interface. It includes a homepage with sector links and individual pages for each sector with corresponding links. The design follows a minimalistic approach with a CVS Health-themed color scheme.

## Usage

To use the OneTouch application, follow these steps:

1. Visit the homepage by opening `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Click on the sector links (Infrastructure, Pharma, or Retail) to access specific sector pages.
3. On the sector pages, you'll find a table listing relevant links, along with their names and addresses.
